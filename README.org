The event loop keeps on running as long as there are event listeners registered. One of such events is the =server.listen(3000);= (example below) function.

*Note*: Nodejs program is single threaded so the event loop implementation is a way to prevent the program to stop and wait for input.

You can exit the event loop by using the =process.exit()= function, this will exit the current event register and kill it.
** Event Loop
The nodejs program will run in a single thread; but some operations are send to a worker process that uses multi threading. Such of these operations are asynchronous IO, cryptography, compression ... basically heavy operation that require computational power.

*** Heavy Load
For heavy load(IO, crypto, compression, etc...), nodejs will send the task to a worker pool, this worker is detached from our code. After the worker is finished with the task it will trigger the callback and inform the event loop.

*** Event Loop Execution
When the event loop starts (or loop back) it will look for pending tasks in the following order:

subgraph A[Timers]
P[Execute setTimeout, setInterval Callbacks]
end
subgraph B[Pending Callbacks]
R[Execute I/O related Callbacks that were deffered]
end
subgraph C[Poll]
S[Retrieve new I/O events, execute their callbacks]
end
subgraph D[Check]
T[Execute setImmediate callback]
end
subgraph E[Close callbacks]
U[Execute all 'close' event callbacks]
end

* Core Modules

** http
Launch a server, send requests.

This is an example of a simple http server. The server listen to any request and =console.log(req)= log the request to console.
#+begin_src js :tangle node_examples/http_example.js
const http = require("http");
const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
    console.log(req);
});
server.listen(3000);
#+end_src

Using the response object.
#+begin_src js :tangle node_examples/http_res_example.js
const http = require("http");
const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
    res.setHeader('Content-Type','text/html');
    res.write('<html>');
    res.write('<h1>Hello from node js server</h1>');
    res.write('</html>');
    res.end();
});
server.listen(3000);
#+end_src
After =res.end()= you should no write any more =res.write()= code.

For more information about the request and response headers you can go to the brwoser's developer tools, in the network tab (after reaload) we can see some of the inner html and server work.

*** Checking URL Routes
We can specify according to the url path the behavior of the server.

In this example if the user request for the root path =/=, then the server will ask for some data.
After the user push the submit button then the request will be sent to the =/message= path and the server will catch the data submitted, redirect the user to the =/= and print the data submitted by the user and the bottom of the page.

**** Streams & Buffers
The incomming data is send as a stream of data. The incomming request is read by node in chunks (multiple parts), this is done so we can start working on the chunks without waiting for the whole process to finish. This is useful when we upload a big file and need to precess it.
#+begin_src mermaid :file stream_buffer.png
flowchart LR
  subgraph S[Incomming Stream]
    direction TB
    T[Stream] --- N[Idea: Start working on that Data early]
    style S fill:#84cfcf
  end
  subgraph BUFF[Buffer]
    direction LR
    C[Request Body Part 3] --- D[Request Body Part 4]
    style BUFF fill:#42aaf5, stroke-width:4px
  end
  subgraph DATA[Data Flow]
    direction LR
    S --- A[Request Body Part 1] --- B[Request Body Part 2] --- BUFF --> P[Fully Parsed]
  end

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:stream_buffer.png]]

A buffer is like a bus stop, you can interact with the data stream. We do this by going to our request function and create an event listener.

There are many kind of events, in the case of an incomming stream there is the =data= event.

#+begin_src js :tangle node_examples/http_req_res_example.js
const http = require("http");

let data = undefined;
const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
    const url = req.url;

    if (url === '/'){
        res.setHeader('Content-Type','text/html');
        res.write('<html>');
        res.write('<h1>Enter Message:</h1>');
        res.write('<form action="/message" method="POST"><input type="text" name="message"></br>')
        res.write('<button type="submit">Send</button></form>')
        res.write(`<p>Data: ${data} </p>`)
        res.write('</html>');
        //Return function.
        return res.end();
    }

    if (url === '/message' && req.method === 'POST'){
        const body = [];
        //Get message and store it in data.
        req.on('data', (chunk)=>{
           body.push(chunk);
        });
        //After the request finish parsing the data then the 'end' event is fired.
        req.on('end', () => {
           data = Buffer.concat(body).toString().split('=',1)[1];
        });
    }
    //Redirecting to home page.
    res.statusCode = 302;
    res.setHeader('Location','/');
    res.end();

});
server.listen(3000);
