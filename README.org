* Program Lifecycle
=node app.js => Start Script => Parse Code, Register Variables & Functions => Event Loop=

The event loop keeps on running as long as there are event listeners registered. One of such events is the =server.listen(3000);= (example below) function.

*Note*: Nodejs program is single threaded so the event loop implementation is a way to prevent the program to stop and wait for input.

You can exit the event loop by using the =process.exit()= function, this will exit the current event register and kill it.


* Core Modules

** http
Launch a server, send requests.

This is an example of a simple http server. The server listen to any request and =console.log(req)= log the request to console.
#+begin_src js :tangle node_examples/http_example.js
const http = require("http");
const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
    console.log(req);
});
server.listen(3000);
#+end_src

** https
Launch a SSL server.
** fs
** path
** os
